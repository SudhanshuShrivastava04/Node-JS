# Versioning in Software Development

Versioning in software development is the practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to specific releases of software. These versions typically follow a structured format, such as `major.minor.patch`, where:

- **Major Version**: The first part of the version number indicates major or breaking changes. It is incremented when significant updates or changes are introduced that may not be backward-compatible.

- **Minor Version**: The second part of the version number indicates recommended bug fixes, improvements, or enhancements. It is incremented for smaller updates that are backward-compatible, including security fixes.

- **Patch Version**: The third part of the version number indicates minor fixes or patches, often addressing specific issues or bugs in the software. It is incremented for very small changes or fixes.

For example, in the version `1.3.4`:

- **Major Version (1)**: Indicates the latest release with major or breaking updates.
- **Minor Version (3)**: Indicates the latest release with recommended bug fixes and improvements.
- **Patch Version (4)**: Indicates the latest release with minor fixes or patches.

Versioning helps developers and users track changes, understand the impact of updates, and manage compatibility across different versions of software.

## Example
For version `1.3.4`, the breakdown is as follows:

- **Major Version**: 1
- **Minor Version**: 3
- **Patch Version**: 4

This structure allows for clear communication about the scope and impact of each release.
